    "The idea behind this project is to develop a system that will warn road-users of the chances and severity of an accident occuring to them. The four factors that determine an accident are weather and road conditions, vehicle characteristics and finally human error. It is easy to deduce that weather and road conditions will have a meaningful impact on the chances and severity of an accident. For vehicle characteristics: a motorbike will have increased chances of a severe accident most of the time due to decreased protection when compared to a car for example. All of these factors influence the final result and must be taken into consideration. Human error is difficult to quantify unless the distraction/error made by the driver has been recorded, as well as being diifcult to predict (that would have to besolved with another model with a different set of attributes). We must look for the aforementioned attributes in our dataset, and use them to deduce the severity and chances of accidents happening with varying road, weather and vehicle conditions."

Human error is another one, but it is almost impossible to determine the chances of the driver being distracted with this dataset. It is only once the accident has happned that we may find out if there was human error involved.\n",

    "PERSONCOUNT, PEDCOUNT, PEDCYLCOUNT, VEHCOUNT, INJURIES, SERIOUSINJURIES, FATALITIES, HITPARKEDCAR are all attributes that easily help in deducing accident severity. But because this is a predictive model, and these attributes cannot be known before the actual accident happens, they are meaningless when trying to predict accident severity and probability. For example, instead of VEHCOUNT, traffic density per location would be an attribute that we could know beforehand and therfore a meaningful attribute for the model. The same for the other attributes. How many people were travelling in the car that had the accident would be useful as well, as it is easily known how many people you are taking in your car before the actual trip. I will not go through the explanation of every single attribute; the main idea is to select attributes that are known and can be qauntified before the accident happened and taht directly contribute to the final result (accident or not and its severity). Data that is recorded as a result of the accident is obviously not useful for predictions.\n",

We can also do statistical tests as an initial screening to determine correlations between different attributes and their respective labels."
